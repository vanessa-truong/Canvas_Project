                <h2>Great ideas happen when we come together</h2>
                <p>We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas
                    that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas Project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to
                    set the backdrop for your next get-together over <span class="blue">Hangouts Meet.</span></p>

                <p>Influenced by the power of collaboration and connection these artists created both photographic and
                    illustrative wallpapers for the Meet experience.
